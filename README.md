# Mine-Blockchain-Commandline
I made a command line application for storing data in a blockchain. I've tried my best to fix all the possible bugs you might come across. You can use the "Mine_backend.py" file as a module directly as well. It uses MySql to store the blocks in the blockchain.

Unrelated note:
I just used this after like 3 months and it's incrediby easy to use. Don't even complain.
